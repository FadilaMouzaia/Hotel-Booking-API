# Hotel Booking API 
This project is for booking hotels, you search for a city, select dates and number of guests. 
You can filter by price. It shows all the available hotels in the area, each one with its description, 
price per day, location, images, and others. The user to make a reservation must register with username, 
email, password, location. Once logged in the user can select a date and select the rooms you need, 
once confirmed, if you want to book that room for those same days, it will not be possible because it is busy and must choose another room or other days or another hotel.
